# Active Context: Roro's Adventure

## Current State Overview
Initial memory bank creation and project analysis. The project appears to be a complete Unity game with multiple stages and systems in place.

## Recent Analysis

1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Identified core game components and systems
   - Mapped scene progression flow
   - Documented technical architecture
   - Cataloged available assets and resources

2. **System Components Review**
   - Main character (RORO) with multiple forms
   - Stage progression system (10 stages)
   - Dialog/chat system implementation
   - Animation framework structure

3. **Implementation Status**
   - Core systems appear to be in place
   - Multiple character forms implemented
   - Stage progression framework established
   - UI and chat systems functional

## Active Considerations

1. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Scene-based progression system
   - Component-based character system
   - Event-driven dialogue system
   - State-based animation system

2. **Current Technical Focus**
   - Understanding existing systems
   - Documenting core functionality
   - Mapping technical dependencies
   - Identifying system relationships

3. **Key Technical Patterns**
   - UnityScript implementation patterns
   - Prefab-based component architecture
   - Scene management approach
   - Asset organization structure

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Completion**
   - Finalize memory bank initialization
   - Complete project analysis documentation
   - Map remaining system relationships
   - Document any identified gaps

2. **System Understanding**
   - Deep dive into script implementations
   - Analysis of animation systems
   - Review of stage progression logic
   - Understanding of transformation mechanics

3. **Technical Review**
   - Verify all systems are documented
   - Identify any missing documentation
   - Review technical constraints
   - Map development patterns

## Project Insights

1. **Development Patterns**
   - Consistent scene numbering convention
   - Organized asset hierarchy
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular system design

2. **Technical Decisions**
   - UnityScript for game logic
   - WebGL build target
   - 2D sprite-based graphics
   - Component-based architecture

3. **Implementation Approach**
   - Scene-based stage progression
   - Prefab-based reusable components
   - Event-driven system communication
   - State-based character management

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Documentation**
   - Initial memory bank setup
   - System documentation
   - Technical pattern documentation
   - Project structure documentation

2. **Analysis**
   - Core systems review
   - Implementation patterns

### 📝 Evolution of Decisions

1. **Technical Choices**
   - Unity as game engine
   - UnityScript for implementation
   - WebGL as build target
   - 2D sprite-based graphics

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Scene-based progression
   - Prefab-based components
   - Event-driven systems
   - Component-based architecture

3. **Implementation Approaches**
   - Modular script organization
   - Reusable prefab system
   - Organized asset hierarchy
   - Clear system separation

## Known Issues

1. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Initial memory bank setup needs validation
   - System relationships may need deeper mapping
